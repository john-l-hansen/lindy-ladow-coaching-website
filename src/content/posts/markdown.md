### Tapping

**Tapping** is also known as EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique). It is a powerful holistic healing technique that resolves a range of issues. It's based on the combined principles of ancient Chinese acupressure and modern psychology. The basic **Tapping** technique requires you to focus on a negative emotion at hand.

I have been tapping with Brad for years and love his simple straight forward meathod. He has short videos on everything one can imagine to tap about. All you have to do is show up and follow along.

## Yoga

Yoga is a set of specific exercises, called poses, combined with specific breathing techniques and meditation principles are the building blocks of a yoga class. If a pose causes pain or proves too difficult, there are variations and modifications that can be made to help students. Props like blocks, blankets and straps — even chairs — can be used to help you get the most benefit from the poses. Yoga is not one-size-fits-all: The best yoga workout for you will depend on your individual needs and goals.

The benefits of a regular yoga practice are wide-ranging. In general, a complete yoga workout can help keep your back and joints healthy, improve your overall posture, stretch and strengthen muscles and improve your balance, says Roger Cole, Ph.D., a psychobiologist and certified Iyengar yoga teacher. Yoga also has “a restorative side that is deeply relaxing and rejuvenating,” Dr. Cole says. “Relaxation is built into every yoga session.”

In addition, yoga’s focus on the breath can calm you and help you learn to be more mindful of your body, says Dr. Timothy McCall, the author of “Yoga as Medicine,” and that can help you to move with greater ease.

In recent years, more and more research is demonstrating the wide-ranging health benefits of yoga: 

**Reduce back pain**

**Strengthen bones**

**Improve balance**

**Stave off mental decline**

**Reduce stress**

**Relieve depression**

## Alternate Nostril Breathing Calm the Mind and Reverse Stress

This is one of my favorite breathing tools. I use when I have a few minutes alone before a presentation, an event or a stressful or exciting situation. In addition to calming the mind and reversing stress, alternate nostril breathing also:

* *Improves our ability to focus the mind*
* *Supports our lungs and respiratory functions*
* *Restores balance in the left and right hemispheres of the brain, and clears the energetic channels*
* *Rejuvenates the nervous system*
* *Removes toxins*
* *Settles stress*

### Reset Mental State

Next time you find yourself doing too many things at once, or you sense panic or anxiety begin to rise, move through a few rounds of alternate nostril breathing. Hit the reset button for your mental state.

1. *Take a comfortable and tall seat, making sure your spine is straight and your heart is open.*
2. *Relax your left palm comfortably into your lap and bring your right hand just in front of your face.*
3. *With your right hand, bring your pointer finger and middle finger to rest between your eyebrows, lightly using them as an anchor. The fingers we’ll be actively using are the thumb and ring finger.*
4. *Close your eyes and take a deep breath in and out through your nose.*
5. *Close your right nostril with your right thumb. Inhale for 4 counts through the left nostril slowly and steadily.*
6. *Close the left nostril with your ring finger so both nostrils are held closed; retain your breath at the top of the inhale for 4 counts.*
7. *Open your right nostril and release the breath slowly for 7 counts.*
8. *Inhale through the right side slowly for 4 counts.*
9. *Hold both nostrils closed for 4 counts (with ring finger and thumb).*
10. *Open your left nostril and release breath slowly through the left side for 7 counts.* 
11. *Repeat 5-10 cycles, allowing your mind to follow your inhales and exhales.*

Steps 5-9 represent one complete cycle of alternate nostril breathing. If you’re moving through the sequence slowly, one cycle should take you about 30-40 seconds. Move through 5-10 cycles when you’re feeling stressed, anxious, or in need of a reset button.

## Breath Workouts

One of the habits that we can add to our toolbox is Breathwork. Breathing delivers oxygen throughout our bodies and removes carbon dioxide. Breath activates our parasympathic nevous system which slows down heart rate and lowers blood pressure. Studies have shown that breathwork can help with issues such as anger, PTSD, anxiety, chronic pain, depression and the emotional effects of illness.

> Furthermore practised breathwork can aid in positive self-development, confidence, self-image, self esteem, boost immunity, process emotions, increase self-awareness, increase happiness and joy, improve relationships and enrich creativity.

There are several breathwork practices and exercises out there. I encourage you to try a few and experiment, some listed below. Try breathing in different ways using you mouth, throat and nose. Use different techniques such as shallow, deep, exggerated or ragged. Breath through one nostril or side of the mouth, pressing your tongue on the roof of your mouth and playing with different sounds. 

### Suggestions:

> *A journal and/or inspiration notebook*
>
> *Do Daily*
>
> *Start with 5 minutes and incrementally increase the time to your goal.* 
>
> *Be aware of the thoughts that come up in your mind.* 
>
> *Observe, no judgement. (This will take time, keep at it and notice the changes.)*
>
> *Feel what emotions come up.*
>
> *Notice inner voice.*
>
> *Visualize intentions.*

The five facets of fear and what we can do physically to give ourselves the space.

When we respond with anger, picture yourself oozing. 

Flight is running physically or mentally away. Ground yourself, imagine you are a sumo wrestler, dig your heels into the ground and raise your arms in right angels parralel with your shoulders.

Faint, open your eyes and mouth wide open. 

Faun, waiting on others. Hug yourself. 

Freeze, wiggle.
