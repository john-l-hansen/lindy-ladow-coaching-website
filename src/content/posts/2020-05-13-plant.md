## Therapy vs. Coaching

Do you NEED help? Chances are if you need help you need therapy?

I believe as a coach that people are in flux and evolving on their path of least resistance. I believe that their higher self has answers, peace and the clarity that they desire.  I coach my clients around those insights.

### Coaching can improve:

> Relationships, Create Business Plans, Acheive Work/Life Balance, Starting a New Business or Grow Current Business.

#### Therapy helps people recover from: 

> Past trauma and explore why past relationships personal or business have been destructive. Therapy helps people work through divorce and the death of a loved one. Therapy works with anxiety or depression that can affect work or home function. 

Therapy can make a medical diagnosis while coaching cannot.
