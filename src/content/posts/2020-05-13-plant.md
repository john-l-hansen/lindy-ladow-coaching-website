## Therapy vs. Coaching

Do you NEED help? Chances are if you need help you need therapy?

I believe as a coach that people are in flux and evolving on their path of least resistance. I believe that their higher self has answers, peace and the clarity that they desire.  I coach my clients around those insights.

Coaching can improve:

> Relationships create business plans, acheive work/life balance, starting a new business or grow current business.

Therapy helps people recover from past trauma and explore why past relationships personal or business have been destructive. Therapy helps people work through divorce and the death of a loved one. Therapy works with anxiety or depression that can affect work or home function. Therapy can make a medical diagnosis while coaching cannot.
