## Therapy vs. Coaching

I believe people are in flux and evolving on their path. I offer my clients additional and alternate perspectives. I coach my clients around those insights.

Do you NEED help? Chances are if you need help you need therapy?

### Coaching can improve:

> Relationships, Create Business, Acheive Work/Life Balance, help create New Business or Grow Current Business and embrace life's transitions.

#### Therapy helps people recover from:

> Past trauma and explore why past relationships personal or business have been destructive. Therapy helps people work through divorce and the death of a loved one. Therapy works with anxiety or depression that can affect work or home function. 

Therapy can make a medical diagnosis while coaching cannot.
