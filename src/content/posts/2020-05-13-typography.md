Breath Workouts

One of the habits that we can add to our toolbox is Breathwork. Breathing delivers oxygen throughout our bodies and removes carbon dioxide. Breath activates our parasympathic nevous system which slows down heart rate and lowers blood pressure. Studies have shown that breathwork can help with issues such as anger, PTSD, anxiety, chronic pain, depression and the emotional effects of illness.

Furthermore practised breathwork can aid in positive self-development, confidence, self-image, self esteem, boost immunity, process emotions, increase self-awareness, increase happiness and joy, improve relationships and enrich creativity.

There are several breathwork practices and exercises out there. I encourage you to try a few and experiment, some listed below. Try breathing in different ways using you mouth, throat and nose. Use different techniques such as shallow, deep, exggerated or ragged. Breath through one nostril or side of the mouth, pressing your tongue on the roof of your mouth and playing with different sounds. 

Breath Workout:

Suggestion, a journal and/or inspiration notebook

Start with 5 minutes and incrementally increase the time to your goal. 

Be aware of the thoughts that come up in your mind. 

Observe, no judgement. (This will take time, keep at it and notice the changes.)

Feel what emotions come up.

Notice inner voice.
