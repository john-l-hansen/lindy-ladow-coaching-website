The five facets of fear and what we can do physically to give ourselves the space.

When we respond with anger, picture yourself oozing. 

Flight is running physically or mentally away. Ground yourself, imagine you are a sumo wrestler, dig your heels into the ground and raise your arms in right angels parralel with your shoulders.

Faint, open your eyes and mouth wide open. 

Faun, waiting on others. Hug yourself. 

Freeze, wiggle.
