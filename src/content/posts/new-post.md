The five facets of fear and what we can do physically to give ourselves the space.

When we respond with anger, picture yourself oozing. 

Flight is running physically or mentally away. Ground yourself, imagine you are a sumo wrestler, dig your heels into the ground and raise your arms in right angels parralel with your shoulders.

Faint, open your eyes and mouth wide open. 

Faun, waiting on others. Hug yourself. 

Freeze, wiggle. 

STOPP

Past Traumatic Possibility - We talk about the pain but what about the possibilities?



## Breath Workouts

One of the habits that we can add to our toolbox is Breathwork. Breathing delivers oxygen throughout our bodies and removes carbon dioxide. Breath activates our parasympathic nevous system which slows down heart rate and lowers blood pressure. Studies have shown that breathwork can help with issues such as anger, PTSD, anxiety, chronic pain, depression and the emotional effects of illness.

> Furthermore practised breathwork can aid in positive self-development, confidence, self-image, self esteem, boost immunity, process emotions, increase self-awareness, increase happiness and joy, improve relationships and enrich creativity.

There are several breathwork practices and exercises out there. I encourage you to try a few and experiment, some listed below. Try breathing in different ways using you mouth, throat and nose. Use different techniques such as shallow, deep, exggerated or ragged. Breath through one nostril or side of the mouth, pressing your tongue on the roof of your mouth and playing with different sounds.
