Reverent: adoration, feeling or showing deep and solumn respect. Worship silently. Feeling deep connection.   Webster Dictionary

Go to every reverent moment you can remember in your life. String them together. What patterns exist there? Feel them.......breath, breath, breath...now what do you want today?

Relevant: The quality or state of being closely connected. Appropriate.

What does relevant mean to you? It is personal you are the filter. Live your preferences. The reverence makes it grow. There if the reference.
