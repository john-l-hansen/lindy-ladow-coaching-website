## Calm the Mind and Reverse Stress

This is a tool I use when I have a few minutes alone before a presentation, an event or a stressful situation. In addition to calming the mind and reversing stress, alternate nostril breathing also:

* Improves our ability to focus the mind
* Supports our lungs and respiratory functions
* Restores balance in the left and right hemispheres of the brain, and clears the energetic channels
* Rejuvenates the nervous system
* Removes toxins
* Settles stress



### Reset Mental State

Next time you find yourself doing too many things at once, or you sense panic or anxiety begin to rise, move through a few rounds of alternate nostril breathing. Hit the reset button for your mental state.

1. Take a comfortable and tall seat, making sure your spine is straight and your heart is open.
2. Relax your left palm comfortably into your lap and bring your right hand just in front of your face.
3. With your right hand, bring your pointer finger and middle finger to rest between your eyebrows, lightly using them as an anchor. The fingers we’ll be actively using are the thumb and ring finger.
4. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in and out through your nose.
5. Close your right nostril with your right thumb. Inhale for 4 counts through the left nostril slowly and steadily.
6. Close the left nostril with your ring finger so both nostrils are held closed; retain your breath at the top of the inhale for 4 counts.
7. Open your right nostril and release the breath slowly for 7 counts.
8. Inhale through the right side slowly for 4 counts.
9. Hold both nostrils closed for 4 counts (with ring finger and thumb).
10. Open your left nostril and release breath slowly through the left side for 7 counts. 
11. Repeat 5-10 cycles, allowing your mind to follow your inhales and exhales.

Steps 5-9 represent one complete cycle of alternate nostril breathing. If you’re moving through the sequence slowly, one cycle should take you about 30-40 seconds. Move through 5-10 cycles when you’re feeling stressed, anxious, or in need of a reset button.
