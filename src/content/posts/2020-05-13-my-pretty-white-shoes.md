Know thyself is an ancient Greek aphorism. In 1831 Ralph Waldo Emmerson wrote a poem entitled "Know Thyself" on the theme God in Thee. The poem was an anthem to Emerson's belief that "to know thyself" meant knowing that God exists in us all.

Knowing oneself is a lifelong journey that can lead to fulfillment and joy. The purpose to "know oneself" is also important to align ourselves with our dreams and goals. To understand this knowledge can help us navigate highs and lows with courage. We cannot control what is outside ourselves but what we do control is how we respond. These responses impact our lives more than we comprehend.
