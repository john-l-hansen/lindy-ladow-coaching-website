It was only a sunny smile,

little did it cost in the giving, 

but like the morning light, 

it scattered the night and made the day.

F. Scott Fitzgerald

When was the last time I smiled "to myself" that special little smile that is both knowing and frisky? That smile at the pure delight of knowing my own wild thoughts. These thoughts are exciting, playful and perhaps risky but they make me smile more. The more I smile at my smiling the more centered, grounded and happy I become.

I am not always smiling at me smiling and I know the opposite works as well. I cry a lot. I use to cry more when I was younger. I accpeted it. I contemplated it I wondered about it. Sometimes I would stare at myself crying in the mirror and I would cry more.
