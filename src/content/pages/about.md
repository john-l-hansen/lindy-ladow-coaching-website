I work with perspective and I believe strongly that perspective can be critical to changing oneâ€™s life. Small shifts in perspective add up to transformations previously thought unattainable and build upon a foundation that solidifies with experiences, self-trust, confidence and clarity.

I coach using my experience, which incorporates formal education, high-level executive positions and creating and running my own business.

Coming from a family of entrepreneurs has gifted me with a lifelong passion for business. As an empath my desire is to help people become the best version of themselves.

I served for 14 years as Chief Financial Officer for a commercial construction company that averaged $10m a year. 

As the General Manager of a mid-sized service company,  I helped develop work processes for sales, accounting, project management and operations teams. I was fortunate to be involved in shifting the company into modern business practices including contract management review, marketing presence (SEO, website and branding revisions) and updating work practices for several departments.

I founded a small business focused on retail and shipping services. This endeavor was primarily used as an educational tool for my three children. Some of our favorite moments; setting up new relationships with vendors, creating work practices and processes, reviewing Profit and Loss sheets and passionate dinner conversations about what to shift and change to keep up with changing requirements of business.

I served as the Estate Administrator to an $11m estate in Orange County Probate Court; closed out over 60 different companies, sold commercial and residential properties, other assets and running several business  in operation until assets the were sold. One of the most interesting challenges was chasing a trademark throughout Europe validating that no infringements were committed.

For fun I walk my dog, yoga, game, read, roller skate, hike, cook and garden.
