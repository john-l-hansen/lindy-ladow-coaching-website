## Potential

I believe in potential - in a human being's more potential no matter where one finds self in life. 

I work with perspective and that can change a person's life. A trajectory change that frees a person to become what they dream. These tiny shifts lead to transformations thought unattainable and a foundation built upon the experiences and perceptions wholly unique to each individual meaning a solid foundation. These personal insights also create more self-trust, confidence and clarity. 

I coach with my own experience, education and a passion for leading edge creation. I use intuition, hign level complex pattern recognition and various tools that I have discovered on my path to guide my clients to more abundance in whatever form they desire. 

Born and raised as an entrepreneur I am facinated with business.  As an empath my desire is to help people become the best version of themselves.
