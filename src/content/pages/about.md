---
I work with perspective and I believe strongly that perspective is critical to changing ones' life. Small shifts in perspective add up to transformations previously thought unattainable and build upon a foundation that solidifies with experiences, self-trust, confidence and clarity.

I coach using my experiences, which incorporate formal education as well as being a high level executive and business creator. I also utilize intuition, pattern recognition and other tools that have proven critical to helping others.

Coming from a family of entrepreneurs has gifted me a lifelong passion for business. As an empath my desire is to help people become the best version of themselves.

Served for 14 years as Chief Financial Officer for a commercial construction company that averaged $10m a year in earnings. I was involved in contract review with counsel as well as day-to-day operations.

General Manager of a mid-sized service company in which I helped develop work processes for sales, accounting, project management and operations teams. I was fortunate to be involved in shifting the company into modern business practices including contract management review, marketing presence (including SEO, website and branding revisions) as well as updating work practices for several departments.

Founded a small business focused on retail and shipping services. This endeavour was primarily used as an educational tool for my three children in which I am proud to say they graduated with full honors. Some of our favorite moments are setting up new relationships with vendors, letting my children learn how to create work practices and processes, reviewing Profit and Loss sheets with them - and the passionate dinner conversations about what to shift and change to keep up with the ever changing requirements of customers.

Estate Administrator to an $11m estate in Orange County Probate Court which included closing out over 60 different companies, selling off commercial and residential properties, and running several companies that were in operation until assets were sold. One of the most interesting challenges was chasing a trademark throughout Europe validating that no infringements were committed.

What I love to do for fun: Walking my dog, yoga, gaming, reading, roller skating, hiking, mountains, cooking and gardening.

What is my passion? COACHING
