**I work with perspective and I believe strongly that perspective is critical to changing ones' life. Small shifts in perspective add up to transformations previously thought unattainable and build upon a foundation that solidifies with experiences, self-trust, confidence and clarity.**

**I coach using my experiences, which incorporate formal education as well as being a high level executive and business creator. I also utilize intuition, pattern recognition and other tools that have proven critical to helping others.**



I coach with my own experience, education and a passion for leading edge creation. I use intuition, hign level complex pattern recognition and various tools that I have discovered on my path to guide my clients to more abundance in whatever form they desire. 

Born and raised as an entrepreneur I am facinated with business.  As an empath my desire is to help people become the best version of themselves. 

Proudest Business Acheivments: 

Created a shipping and retail store, where all 3 of my children graduated with business education and experience. Their education included start-up, accounting, sales, operations and the successful sale of the business after 7 years of community service.

I served for 14 Years as CFO for a commercial construction company overseeing small to large contracts including $25 Million in contracts with The Los Angeles Times. I worked with a team of professionals who enjoyed their work.

Estate Administrator to an $11 Million Estate in Orange County Probate Court. Closed 63 companies, sold 2 commercial properties, 1 luxury residential property, vechicles including sprinter limo, a tricked out Harley and a Duffy Boat. Ran several business until closed and chased a trademark across  Europe. This was an extremely complicated estate and because I had the best attorney on the planet we closed this estate in a timely matter with integrity.
